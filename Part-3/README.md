A syntax diagram is a graphical representation of a programming languageâ€™s syntax
rules. Basically, a syntax diagram visually shows you which statements are allowed
in your programming language and which are not.

The process of recognizing a phrase in the stream of tokens is called parsing.
And the part of an interpreter or compiler that performs that job is called a
parser. Parsing is also called syntax analysis, and the parser is also aptly called
a syntax analyzer.
